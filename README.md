# Introduction

This repository is related to an behavioral experiment on the perception of
object stability under various situations that perturbs the perception of
the gravity direction. You will find here the raw data and the code for
processing the raw data and for doing the statistical analysis (in R).

The study related to this data/code is currently under submission to a peer
reviewed journal. The instruction for running the code is still absent, but
will be added in the near future. More coming soon.
